      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Hopefully, we can all agree now that interest rates are an extremely powerful tool. 
      </p> 

      <p> 
        However, many people, especially the poor often ignore the consequences of high interest rates. 
      </p>

      <p>
        This is due to the psychological actions of humans overvaluing the importance of current gradification as opposed to waiting a few days.
      <p>

      <p> 
        Think about this if you stand close to a small house, that house is all you can see and you might be tempted to live there. However if you take a few steps back you might be ablt to see a skyscrapper of wealth behing it. This reveals the importance of delaying gratification and earning much more over the long run.
