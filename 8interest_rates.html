      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Interest Rates are obviously extremely powerful tool. 
      </p> 

      <p> 
        However, many people, especially the poor, often ignore the consequences of high interest rates. 
      </p>

      <p>
        This is due to the psychological actions of humans overvaluing the importance of current gradification as opposed to waiting a few days.
      <p>

      <p> 
        Think, if you stand close to a nice small house, that house is all you can see. However, there could be a skyscrapper of wealth behing it. All you need to do is take a few steps backwards and learn that by delaying gratification you can earn much more over the long run.
