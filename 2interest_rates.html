      <h2>Time Value of Money</h2>
      <p>
        Let me start by asking you a simple question.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Which would you prefer?</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        <div class="button" id="20today">$20 Today</div>
        <div class="button" id="25twoWeeks">$25 in Two Weeks</div>
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Let's get even easier. What would you prefer?</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        <div class="button" id="aDollarToday">A Dollar Today</div>
        <div class="button" id="aDollarTomorrow">A Dollar Tomorrow</div>
      </p>

      <p>
        Time Value of Money is the idea that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future, because the dollar received today can earn INTEREST up until the time the future dollar is received.
